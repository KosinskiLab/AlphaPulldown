.TH KEY.DNS_RESOLVER 8 "04 Mar 2011" Linux "Linux Key Management Utilities"
.SH NAME
key.dns_resolver \- upcall for request\-key to handle dns_resolver keys
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/sbin/key.dns_resolver \fR<key>
.br
\fB/sbin/key.dns_resolver \fR\-D [\-v] [\-v] <keydesc> <calloutinfo>
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is invoked by request\-key on behalf of the kernel when kernel
services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to perform a hostname lookup and the
kernel does not have the key cached.  It is not ordinarily intended to be
called directly.
.P
It can be called in debugging mode to test its functionality by passing a
\fB\-D\fR flag on the command line.  For this to work, the key description and
the callout information must be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased by
supplying one or more \fB\-v\fR flags.
.SH ERRORS
All errors will be logged to the syslog.
