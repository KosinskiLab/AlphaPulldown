.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm

method.  If a preferred method is available, it is the same as the
one also used by the

if their given

parameter is NULL.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

If no preferred hash method is available it is NULL.  It
.Em is
safe to pass the string returned by
.Nm crypt_preferred_method
directly to
.Nm crypt_gensalt
without prior string-sanitizing nor NULL-pointer checks.
.Sh FEATURE TEST MACROS
.In crypt.h
will define the macro
.Dv CRYPT_PREFERRED_METHOD_AVAILABLE
if
.Nm
is available in the current version of libxcrypt.
.Sh PORTABILITY NOTES
The function
.Nm
is not part of any standard.
It was added to libxcrypt in version 4.4.0.
