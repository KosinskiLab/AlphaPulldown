# conda-libmamba-solver

The fast mamba solver, now in conda!

## What is this exactly?

conda-libmamba-solver is a new solver for the
[conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/) which uses the solver from the
[mamba project](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) behind the scenes, while
carefully implementing conda's functionality and expected behaviors on top.
The library used by mamba to do the heavy-lifting is called [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv).

Additional information about the project can be found in the blog post on Anaconda's weblog:
[A Faster Solver for Conda: Libmamba](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community).

## Documentation

Check the [documentation](https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/) for
instructions on how to install, use and make the most out the new conda solver!
