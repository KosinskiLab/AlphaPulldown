.TH EDITLINE 7 "April 6, 2024" ""
.SH NAME
\fBeditline\fP
\- line editing user interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a program using the
\fBeditline\fP(3)
library prompts for an input string using the function
\fBel_wgets\fP(3),
it reads characters from the terminal.
Invalid input bytes that do not form characters are silently
discarded.
For each character read, one editor command is executed.
The mapping of input characters to editor commands depends on the
editing mode.
There are three editing modes: vi insert mode, vi command mode,
and emacs mode.
The default is vi insert mode.
The program can switch the default to emacs mode by using the
\fBel_set\fP(3)
or
\fBel_parse\fP(3)
functions, and the user can switch to emacs mode either in the
\fBeditrc\fP(5)
configuration file or interactively with the
\fBed-command\fP
editor command, in all three cases executing the
\fBbind Fl e\fP
builtin command.

If trying to read from the terminal results in end of file or an
error, the library signals end of file to the program and does not
return a string.
.SS Input character bindings
All default bindings described below can be overridden by individual
programs and can be changed with the
\fBeditrc\fP(5)
\fBbind\fP
builtin command.

In the following tables,
`Ctrl-'
indicates a character with the bit 0x40 flipped, and
`Meta-'
indicates a character with the bit 0x80 set.
In vi insert mode and in emacs mode, all Meta-characters considered
printable by the current
\fBlocale\fP(1)
are bound to
\fBed-insert\fP
instead of to the editor command listed below.
Consequently, in UTF-8 mode, most of the Meta-characters are not
directly accessible because their code points are occupied by
printable Unicode characters, and Meta-characters are usually input
using the
\fBem-meta-next\fP
editor command.
For example, to enter
`Meta-B'
in order to call the
\fBed-prev-word\fP
editor command in emacs mode, call
\fBem-meta-next\fP
by pressing and releasing the escape key (or equivalently, Ctrl-[),
then press and release the
`B'
key.
If you have configured a Meta-key on your keyboard, for example
with
`setxkbmap' -option altwin:left_meta_win ,
the Ctrl-Meta-characters are directly accessible.
For example, to enter
`Ctrl-Meta-H'
in order to call the
\fBed-delete-prev-word\fP
editor command in emacs mode, hold down the keys
`Ctrl',
`Meta',
and
`H'
at the same time.
Alternatively, press and release the escape key, then press and
release
`Ctrl-H'.

In vi input mode, input characters are bound to the following editor
commands by default:
It Ctrl-D, EOF Ta \fBvi-list-or-eof\fP
It Ctrl-H, BS Ta \fBvi-delete-prev-char\fP
It Ctrl-J, LF Ta \fBed-newline\fP

The remaining
\fBascii\fP(7)
characters in the range 0x20 to 0x7e are bound to
\fBed-insert\fP.

If standard output is not connected to a terminal device
or
\fBel_set\fP(3)
was used to set
EL_EDITMODE
to 0, all input character bindings are disabled and all characters
typed are appended to the edit buffer.
In that case, the edit buffer is returned to the program after a
newline or carriage return character is typed, or after the first
character typed if
\fBel_set\fP(3)
was used to set
EL_UNBUFFERED
to non-zero.
.SS Editor commands
Most editor commands accept an optional argument.
The argument is entered by prefixing the editor command with one
or more of the editor commands
\fBed-argument-digit\fP,
\fBed-digit\fP,
\fBem-universal-argument\fP,
or
\fBvi-zero\fP.
When an argument is not provided, it defaults to 1.
For most editor commands, the effect of an argument is to repeatedly
execute the command that number of times.

When talking about a character string from a left character to a
right character, the left character is included in the string, while
the right character is not included.

If an editor command causes an error, the input character is discarded,
no action occurs, and the terminal bell is rung.
In case of a non-fatal error, the terminal bell is also rung,
but the editor command takes effect anyway.

In the following list, the default key bindings are listed after
each editor command.
.TP
\fBed-argument-digit Pq vi command: 1 to 9; emacs: Meta-0 to Meta-9\fP
If in argument input mode, append the input digit to the argument
being read.

existing argument is already greater than a million.

.SS Macros
If an input character is bound to the editor command
\fBed-sequence-lead-in\fP,
\fBeditline\fP
attempts to call a macro.
If the input character by itself forms the name of a macro, that
macro is executed.
Otherwise, additional input characters are read until the string
read forms the name of a macro, in which case that macro is executed,
or until the string read matches the beginning of none of the existing
macro names, in which case the string including the final, mismatching
character is discarded and the terminal bell is rung.

There are two kinds of macros.
Command macros execute a single editor command.
Keyboard macros return a string of characters that is appended
as a new line to the
.B Input Queue .

The following command macros are defined by default in vi command
mode and in emacs mode:
It Esc \&[ A, Esc O A Ta \fBed-prev-history\fP
It Esc \&[ B, Esc O B Ta \fBed-next-history\fP
It Esc \&[ C, Esc O C Ta \fBed-next-char\fP
It Esc \&[ D, Esc O D Ta \fBed-prev-char\fP
It Esc \&[ F, Esc O F Ta \fBed-move-to-end\fP
It Esc \&[ H, Esc O H Ta \fBed-move-to-beg\fP

In vi command mode, they are also defined by default without the
initial escape character.

In addition, the
\fBeditline\fP
library tries to bind the strings generated by the arrow keys
as reported by the
\fBterminfo\fP(5)
database to these editor commands, unless that would clobber
user settings.

In emacs mode, the two-character string
``Ctrl-X Ctrl-X''
is bound to the
\fBem-exchange-mark\fP
editor command.
.SS Input Queue
The
\fBeditline\fP
library maintains an input queue operated in FIFO mode.
Whenever it needs an input character, it takes the first character
from the first line of the input queue.
When the queue is empty, it reads from the terminal.

A line can be appended to the end of the input queue in several ways:
It
By calling one of the keyboard
.B Macros .
It
By calling the editor command
\fBvi-redo\fP.
It
By calling the editor command
\fBvi-alias\fP.
It
By pressing a key in emacs incremental search mode that doesn't
have a special meaning in that mode but returns to normal emacs
mode.
It
If an application program directly calls the functions
\fBel_push\fP(3)
or
\fBel_wpush\fP(3),
it can provide additional, program-specific ways
of appending to the input queue.
