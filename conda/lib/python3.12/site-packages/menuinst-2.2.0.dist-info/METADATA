# menuinst: cross platform menu item installation

This package provides cross platform menu item installation for `conda` packages.

If a conda package ships a [menuinst JSON document][reference] under `$PREFIX/Menu`, `conda` will invoke
`menuinst` to process the JSON file and install the menu items in your operating system.
The menu items are removed when the package is uninstalled.

The following formats are supported:

- Windows: `.lnk` files in the Start menu. Optionally, also in the Desktop and Quick Launch.
- macOS: `.app` bundles in the Applications folder.
- Linux: `.desktop` files as defined in the XDG standard.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at https://conda.github.io/menuinst/.

## History

This package was originally developed and maintained by Enthought under the name AppInst. The name
appinst is a rename of what used to be called 'wininst'.

`menuinst` v1 was only supported on Windows.  Legacy code existed in v1 for Linux and OS X - use at your own risk.  It may mess up your menus.

`menuinst` v2 is a backwards-compatible rewrite to address cross-platform compatibility under a
unified JSON schema, as discussed in [CEP-11][CEP-11]. The Windows bits of the v1 code are still
available under the `menuinst._legacy` subpackage.
